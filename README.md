Let the given set A have a elements and R be a relation defined on A. Let M_{R} ben n \notin n

of the relation R. Step 1: Denote the matrix M_{R} by W_{0} W for Warshall).

Step 2: Now, consider a blank square matrix of order n and denote it by w_{v} Transfera T_{1}

from W_{0} the first column and first row. Observe the first column of w_{0} and the first row of w_{0} and find the positions of t W_{t}

If 1 appears in P1, P2 positions of the first column and 1 appears in q_{1} q_{2} positions of

the first row, then put 1 in the position p|q_{j}| of the above blank matrix (if 1 is not already there) Put 0 in all other positions of the above matrix and get the completed matrix w_{1} Step 4: Write a blank matrix of order r again and denote it by W_{2} Transfer all 1's from the

matrix w_{1} W_{2} Now, observe the second column of w_{1} and second row of w_{1} If 1 appears in p_{1} positions of the second column and in positions of the second row, put 1 in the positions p, q_{j} of the above matrix W_{2} p_{2} q_{1}, q_{2}

Step 5: Repeat the procedure till you get W_{n} in which no change is possible. Note that to up the matrix w_{k} we consider the kth column and kth row of the matrix w k - 1 .

The procedure will be clearer after you read the solution of the following example
